# AndME
Android Minimal Edition Launcher

# Description
AndME launcher is an extremely minimalistic launcher for Android, inspired by the Windows Phone 7.5 Operating System. By default the application supports pinning and unpinning applications to the homescreen. This launcher supports enterprise apps, or the work profile, by providing a button to switch between the apps profile in the list of applications.

# Tutorial
- Add applications to the homescreen by pressing and holding an app in the list of applications (second page).
- Remove applications by pressing and holding an app by it's logo (center of tile) on the homescreen (first page).
- Reorder applications by dragging from the edges of an app (border of tile) on the homescreen (first page).

Do you want to display more files or change colors? At the moment this application does not include a settings screen. However, you can change properties by opening the project in Android Studio and configuring your desired settings from there.

# Usage
Download and launch the apk from your Android device.
