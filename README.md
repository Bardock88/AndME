# Description
AndME launcher is an extremely minimalistic launcher for Android, inspired by the Windows Phone 7.5 operating system. This launcher supports enterprise apps, or the work profile, by providing a button to switch between the apps profile in the list of applications.

# Tutorial
- Add applications to the homescreen by pressing and holding an app in the list of applications (second page).
- Remove applications by pressing and holding an app by it's logo (center of tile) on the homescreen (first page).
- Reorder applications by dragging from the edges of an app (border of tile) on the homescreen (first page).

# Usage
Download, sideload and launch the apk from your Android device.

[Releases](https://github.com/jetspiking/AndME/releases)

# Customization
Version 1.0.0 added customization to the launcher. The following can be adjusted:

- Tile span count
- Accent color (ARGB)
- Background color (ARGB)
- Text color (ARGB)
- Show or hide icons in app list
- Show or hide navigation bar
