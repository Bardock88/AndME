# Description
AndME launcher is an extremely minimalistic launcher for Android, inspired by the Windows Phone 7.5 operating system. This launcher supports enterprise apps, or the work profile, by providing a button to switch between the apps profile in the list of applications.

# Tutorial
- Add applications to the homescreen by pressing and holding an app in the list of applications (second page).
- Remove applications by pressing and holding an app by it's logo (center of tile) on the homescreen (first page).
- Reorder applications by dragging from the edges of an app (border of tile) on the homescreen (first page).
- Adjust application settings by scrolling to the settings page (third page).
- Navigate between the different pages by swiping from right to left and vice versa.

# Usage
Download, sideload and launch the apk from your Android device.
